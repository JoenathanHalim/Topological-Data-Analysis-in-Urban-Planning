## Summary
I introduce the concept of algebraic topology to urban planning. Specifically, it is used to define a metric that records the level of activity in a location over several temporal resolutions. Formally, this is called a beat, and the set of beats over several temporal resolutions is called a pulse. The goal of this project is to implement this framework in R.
